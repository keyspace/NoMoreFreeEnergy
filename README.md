# No More Free Energy!

A mod for Space Engineers, rebalancing the O2/H2 generator so that the laws of thermodynamics
are not violated; and the hydrogen engine, so that it doesn't become a near-useless block
afterwards.

There are also other re-balancing settings to make the hydrogen engine a worthy competitor
to the battery as a power source, but they are left at a multiplier of 1 by default to
cause less surprises.
